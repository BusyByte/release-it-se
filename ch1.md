# Living in Production

more to development than adding features

what systems should not do

recover from unanticipated trauma and prevent what you can

## Aiming for the Right Target

design for production not just for QA

## The Scope of the Challenge

how many 9's uptime do you need?

## A Million Dollars Here, a Million Dollars There

don't optimize development cost at the expense of operational cost

recurring operational cost can dwarf development cost

## Use the Force

availability, capacity, and flexibility

## Pragmatic Architecture

don't architect for architecture sake

memory, cpu, bandwidth, benefits and drawbacks

w/o rebooting, metrics

no perfection; good enough for current stresses and adjust as change
 
## Wrapping Up

production is a prelude

initial release onward

stability

keep software from crashing
