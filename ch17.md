# Chaos Engineering

want to kill few boxes here and there in production

visit from HR and trip to local psychiatric facility

## Breaking Things to Make Them Better

don't use models of what `should do`

run experiments to see what `it does`

QA environments are not guide to large scale behavior of 
systems in production

economics of staging environments

two services may be safe on their own 

but composition isn't safe

50ms timeout with 2 sequential calls 
- average of 20 ms
- 30 ms p99.9

sizable percentage will break 50 ms

## Antecedents of Chaos Engineering

`Drift into Failure`

- Limits of Safety
- Limits of Capacity
- Limits of Economy

`Drift over time` to `Safety Barrier`

Flight
- optimum for speed (at cost of fuel)
- optimum for cost close to stall and more turbulence

optimize for maximum gain

push throughput to maximum machines and network can bear

up until disruption 

`Generalized Principles of System Design`

`fundamental regulator paradox`

The better job a regulator does the less information 
it gets on how to improve.

`You don't know how much you depend on your IT staff until 
they go on vacation`

`Volkswagon microbus` paradox

you learn how to fix things that often break

`Antifragile`

## The Simian Army

Netflix's `Chaos Monkey`

`If something hurts, do it more often`

Other Monkeys

## Opt in or Opt Out

start with Opt-In for adoption and move to Opt-Out

## Adopting Your Own Monkey

### Prerequisites

can't kill company or customers

break the system without breaking the bank

pick victims based on criteria

trace request through tiers of your system

know what healthy looks like

have a recovery plan when chaos test is finished so can 
restore if not automatically come back

### Designing the Experiment

begin with a hypothesis

focus on external behavior not internal

healthy state of system as a whole

evidence might reject hypothesis

### Injecting Chaos

kill instances

add latency

mark request as failing x layers deep with cookie and not make the request

### Targeting Chaos

choose random instance of random service

not going to get everything though

#### Cunning Malevolent Intelligence

learn what ones are not failure causing and trim them out

### Automate and Repeat

best case boring because system runs as usual

- fix specific instance of weakness
- see if other parts of system vulnerable to same weakness

decide how much chaos to apply, when, to whom, and which are off-limits

## Disaster Situations

systemic weaknesses in the human side

"business continuity"

"zombie apocalypse simulation"

record situations where only one person can do X

postmortem on outage

correct gaps

have way to abort the exercise

## Wrapping Up

break things regularly in controlled way to make software and people more resilient
