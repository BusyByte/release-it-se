# Security

## The OWASP Top 10

### Injection

attack on parser which relies on user-supplied input

SQL

data in the database may have originated from an user as well

XML

XXE injection

OWASP XXE Prevention Cheat Sheet

eval injection on XPATH

### Broken Authentication and Session Management

"session hijacking"

XSS - cross site scripting attacks

session fixation

session prediction

- based on user data is wrong
- based on sequence number is wrong

- long session id with lots of entropy
- one with good crypto properties and not language rand
- protect against XSS
- always generate a new session id per user
- use feature built in to platform and update
- disable other ways to get session ids

no clear text passwords - tls certificates

Lets Encrypt

large enterprise bride ldap to kerberos

"Authentication" verify identity of the caller

authentication everywhere not just boundaries

can't trust IPs

- don't keep passwords in the db
- never email password as part of forgot password process
- apply strong hash algorithm to password, use salt
- do not allow users to use overly long passwords
- do not allow users to paste passwords into GUIs
- plan on re-hashing passwords to increase strength with new salt in future
- don't allow attackers unlimited authentication attempts

kerberos, NTLM, OAuth are 3rd party authentication systems

### Cross Site Scripting

render a user's input directly into HTML without input escaping

front-end apps also vulnerable by putting directly into DOM

automated scanning tools work well

never trust input
- scrub on way in
- escape on way out

OWASP's Java Encoder Project
XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet

HTML library that escapes everything unless told explicitly not to

## Broken Access Control

allow attackers to access data they shouldn't be able to

### Deter URL probing

use unique but non sequential id's in urls

### Authorize Access to Objects

check authorization on ever request

be cautious of 403 vs 404 and probe for existence of customers

don't run as root for ftp

file uploads don't use file name and generate unique, random one instead

store filename in db

### Security Mis-configuration

default un/pw

use personal account not a group account

### Sensitive Data Exposure

- don't store sensitive data you don't need to
- use http strict transport security
- stop using sha-1
- never store passwords in plain text
 - OWASP's Password Storage Cheat Sheet for hash algorithms and good salting 
- decrypt data based on the user's authorization not the server's

AWS KMS
HashiCorp Vault

### Insufficient Attack Protection

blacklist 

can be CRL or ad name

API Gateway
- throttle requests
- block callers by api key

application layer firewalls - layer 7 firewalls

### Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

1st make sure can't your site can't be used to launch CSRF

XSS

requests with side effects use anti-CSRF tokens

SameSite=strict on cookies

RFC recommends 2 cookies
- Read cookie not same-site for GET requests
- Write cookie same-site for state-changing requests

OWASP Cheat sheet for CSRF prevention


### Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

keep applications up-to-date

coming to grips with dependency tree

build tool to create report of all artifacts which went into the build

keep report someplace and check once a week against latest CVEs

use build tool which breaks build if there's a CVE against any of your dependencies

buy VersionEye


### Underprotected APIs

attacker can not access data original user was not able to see

use TLS and reject protocol downgrades

keep root CA files up-to-date

business to business APIs may want to use bidirectional certificates

parser hardened against malicious input

use generative testing library

fuzz-testing APIs especially important

## The Principle of Least Privilege

process should have lowest level of privilege needed to accomplish task

don't run as root or admin unless needed

root vulnerabilities are critical

Apache and Postgres users should be separate users


web servers want port 80 but web server behind a load balancer can use any port

### Containers and Least Privilege

timed builds for any app not under active development

## Configured Passwords

password in text file is vulnerable

db password for db with customer info worth thousands of dollars

must be protected with highest security achievable

passwords kept separate from other config files

readable to application owner and kept out of install directory

password vaulting

AWS KMS 

expunge key from memory ASAP to prevent memory dump

## Security as an Ongoing Process

frameworks or one time AppSec team review can't protect

security is ongoing activity

part of architecture

process to discover attacks and remediate your system quickly

vigilant about patching

make sure can redeploy servers on a moment notice


## Wrapping Up

component -level and system as whole

user data - especially credit card information

Internal APIs need protected

Encrypt on the wire, even inside an organization

intersection of software architecture, operations, and security

CVEs, CWEs, and CERTs
