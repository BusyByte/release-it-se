# Design for Deployment

## So Many Machines

pets and cattle - mayflies

## The Fallacy of Planned Downtime

to users down time is down time

there's always a release

best if users don't know it happened

automation, orchestration, zero-downtime deployment

## Automated Deployment

goal - design applications so easier to deploy

first tool - build pipeline

build funnel

Jenkins and GoCD

Spinnaker and AWS Code Pipeline

configuration management

convergence and desired state

immutable infrastructure - immutable and disposable infrastructure

argue convergence never works

start from master OS image

build a new machine - delete old one

## Continuous Deployment

between development time and runs in prod code is a liability

undeployed code - unfinished liability

vicious cycle - deployment size and risk

"if it hurts, do it more often"

"Do everything continuously."

run full pipeline on every commit

## Phases of Deployment

First - how long does it take to prepare switch over

deploy new image

Second - how long does take to drain activity after stop taking requests

shutdown - stuck threads

Third - how long apply changes

Finally - how long after starting does it accept new load

### Relation Database Schemata

migration frameworks like Liquibase

safe changes
- adding a table
- adding a view
- adding a nullable column to a table
- adding alias or synonyms
- adding new stored procedure
- adding triggers
- copy existing data in to tables or columns

expansion phase

triggers ok as long as don't throw exceptions

shims bit of code to join old and new versions

insert trigger insert into split tables

update trigger

production data not clean and a lot of it

test on copies of real production data

### Schemaless Databases 

application read any version ever created

doc reader - version 2 to version 3 translator

chain translators until current

write all documents back and re-issue read

migrate version of application read new document 
without migrating first

`trickle, then batch`
