# Design for Deployment

## Rating 

pretty good, had lists, useful

## So Many Machines

pets and cattle - mayflies

## The Fallacy of Planned Downtime

to users down time is down time

there's always a release

best if users don't know it happened

automation, orchestration, zero-downtime deployment

## Automated Deployment

goal - design applications so easier to deploy

first tool - build pipeline

build funnel

Jenkins and GoCD

Spinnaker and AWS Code Pipeline

configuration management

convergence and desired state

immutable infrastructure - immutable and disposable infrastructure

argue convergence never works

start from master OS image

build a new machine - delete old one

## Continuous Deployment

between development time and runs in prod code is a liability

undeployed code - unfinished liability

vicious cycle - deployment size and risk

"if it hurts, do it more often"

"Do everything continuously."

run full pipeline on every commit

## Phases of Deployment

First - how long does it take to prepare switch over

deploy new image

Second - how long does take to drain activity after stop taking requests

shutdown - stuck threads

Third - how long apply changes

Finally - how long after starting does it accept new load

### Relation Database Schemata

migration frameworks like Liquibase

safe changes
- adding a table
- adding a view
- adding a nullable column to a table
- adding alias or synonyms
- adding new stored procedure
- adding triggers
- copy existing data in to tables or columns

expansion phase

triggers ok as long as don't throw exceptions

shims bit of code to join old and new versions

insert trigger insert into split tables

update trigger

production data not clean and a lot of it

test on copies of real production data

### Schemaless Databases 

application read any version ever created

doc reader - version 2 to version 3 translator

chain translators until current

write all documents back and re-issue read

migrate version of application read new document 
without migrating first

`trickle, then batch`

migrate docs as touched

amortizes batch migration time across many requests

after in prod a while run a batch migration on remaining

once batch migration done remove code checking for old version

### Web Assets

images, style sheets, JavaScript

cache-busting, versioning, and session affinity

static resources - far future cache expiration headers

git commit sha for version identifier

filename instead of query string

### Rollout

first group canary group

monitor anomalies in metrics

end to end health check

bring up in old cluster

need session stickiness

bring up in new cluster and switch ip

can be abrupt to users

### Cleanup

delete shims / triggers

contraction or tightening of the schema

- drop old tables
- drop old views
- drop old columns
- drop aliases and synonyms no longer used
- drop stored procedures no longer called
- apply NOT NULL constraints on new columns
- apply foreign key constraints

delete documents or keys no longer used

evaluate feature toggles and schedule old ones for removal

## Deploy Like the Pros

large changes in small steps

humans define rules, computers enforce them

## Wrapping Up

deployed early and often

zero-downtime

smaller easier deployments make a big changes over a series of small steps

reduces disruption to users

## Next

chapter 14 and 15 - Ignacio lead next time
