# Handling Versions

maintain compatibility rather than create work for several other teams

software can be a good citizen

## Help Others Handle Your Versions

coordinating consumer and producer deployments doesn't scale

most new versions of the service should be compatible

### Nonbreaking API Changes

Postel's robustness principle:

`Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.`

agreements in order to communicate
- connection handshaking and duration
- request framing
- context encoding
- message syntax
- message semantics
- authorization and authentication

pick HTTP family

list of changes which would break agreements
- reject network protocol previously worked
- reject request framing or content encoding that previously worked
- reject request syntax which previously worked
- reject request routing which previously worked
- adding required fields to the request
- forbidding optional information on the request that was allowed before
- removing information from the response that was previously guaranteed
- requiring an increased level of authorization

generative testing to find gaps between documented protocol and implementation

Swagger/OpenAPI

`inbound` testing - test API

`outbound` testing - test dependencies

FIT tests

### Breaking API Changes

put a version number in request and reply

version of the format and not the application

1) add a version to the URL - prefix or query parameter
2) Accept header on GET to indicate version wanted. 
Content-Type header on PUT/POST to indicate version being sent. eg "application/vnd.lendzit.loan-request.v2" vs 
"application/vnd.lendzit.loan-request.v1"  Some frameworks don't support easily because not 
`application/json` or `text/xml`
3) custom header like `api-version`
4) PUT/POST add field in request to indicate intended version

recommend the URL

benefits outweigh drawbacks

support old and new versions for period of time

both version operate side by side

bump all route version numbers at same time

### Handle Others' Versions

always be defensive

contract tests on provider

## Wrapping Up

everyone thinks globally and acts locally
