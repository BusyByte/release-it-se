# Case Study: Trampled by Your Own Customers

## Countdown and Launch

Big Bang Release 250,000 sessions crashed site

## Aiming for Quality Assurance

### Conway's Law

software architecture mirrors org communication structure

replacing entire stack adds a lot of technical risk

capacity, stability, control, and adaptability all giant question marks

built to pass testing not run in production

scattered across config files

assumed qa topology

ask questions and get no answers
- nobody knows the answers
- nobody wants to be seen answering the questions

editing thousands of files in middle of night for each new software release

keep production passwords out of source control

## Load Testing

month for testing

support 25,000 users

counting sessions over-estimates the number of users because of dead-time

simulate real usage and scale to match production

handle 12k sessions and estimated 10k users after re-architecture

thought 12k would suffice instead of 25k

## Murder by Masses

search engines drove 40 percent of traffic

created session for each 404

scraper bots, would not obey robots.txt if had one

`random weird stuff`

## The Testing Gap

tested the application `the way it was meant to be used`

add noise, create chaos

new threads pile up onto the ones already broken or hung

ability to recover from insults

## Aftermath

gateway for pages without cookies

throttle to new sessions allowed

block specific IP from hitting the site

1k db lookups to render personalized page

most did not present cookie so personalization not possible

static page for unidentified customers

stored 500 records in session from last search - disable session failover
