# Control Plane

production software - If production user data passe through it

control plane - main job is to manage other software

## How Much is Right for You?

every part is optional

more sophisticated the more costly

cost spread out with more

cost not static

don't install everything you read about

keep evaluating overhead and difficulty of different solutions

## Mechanical Advantage

multiplier on human effort simple machines bring

good or for ill

overeager automation

Governor pattern

S3 outage lasted 2 hours

reboot day for SaaS

Every Postmortem has 3 important jobs to do:

1) Explain what has happened
2) Apologize
3) Commit to improvement

### System Failure, Not Human Error

shock and horror when personally caused an outage

"human error" doesn't appear in postmortem anywhere

learn from successes and failures

### Automation Goes Really Fast

auto-scale service shut down remaining services and left only tiny amount

shutting down more than 50% needs human confirmation

automation has no judgement

automation for things humans bad at:
- repetitive task
- fast response

humans for things automation bad at:
- perceiving the whole situation at a higher level

## Platform and Ecosystem

ownership of domain to providing a service to customers

implement tools to support developers

database administrator

database architect

post rdbm - data model up to developer

separate physical database for each service

platform - enable customers

concentrate on safety and performance

## Development is Production

virtual QA environments - on demand

### System-Wide Transparency

Two questions:
- are users receiving a good experience?
- is the system creating economic value we want?

### Real-User Monitoring

real-user monitoring (RUM)
report-centralized service

New Relic - Data Dog
App Dynamics - CA's APM

don't use any "dead zones" in your systems

dashboards and graphs

#### Economic Value

"top line" and "bottom line"

- business process and drop off in logs with exceptions being thrown
- depth of queues

transparency tools
- improve performance and reduce queues
- bottleneck keeps from increasing top line
- increase bottom line - overscaled
- replace slow-performance or large-footprint with more efficient ones

#### Risk of Fragmentation

see how releases affect user engagement or conversion rates affect latency

#### Logs and Stats

logs and metrics collectors

push or pull mode

Splunk or Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana

#### What to Expose

- Traffic indicators
- Business transaction, for each type
- Users
- Resource pool health
- Database connection health
- Data consumption
- Integration point health
  - circuit breaker state
- Cache health
