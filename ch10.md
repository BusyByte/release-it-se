# Control Plane

production software - If production user data passe through it

control plane - main job is to manage other software

## How Much is Right for You?

every part is optional

more sophisticated the more costly

cost spread out with more

cost not static

don't install everything you read about

keep evaluating overhead and difficulty of different solutions

## Mechanical Advantage

multiplier on human effort simple machines bring

good or for ill

overeager automation

Governor pattern

S3 outage lasted 2 hours

reboot day for SaaS

Every Postmortem has 3 important jobs to do:

1) Explain what has happened
2) Apologize
3) Commit to improvement

### System Failure, Not Human Error

shock and horror when personally caused an outage

"human error" doesn't appear in postmortem anywhere

learn from successes and failures

### Automation Goes Really Fast

auto-scale service shut down remaining services and left only tiny amount

shutting down more than 50% needs human confirmation

automation has no judgement

automation for things humans bad at:
- repetitive task
- fast response

humans for things automation bad at:
- perceiving the whole situation at a higher level

## Platform and Ecosystem

ownership of domain to providing a service to customers

implement tools to support developers

database administrator

database architect

post rdbm - data model up to developer

separate physical database for each service

platform - enable customers

concentrate on safety and performance

## Development is Production

virtual QA environments - on demand

### System-Wide Transparency

Two questions:
- are users receiving a good experience?
- is the system creating economic value we want?

### Real-User Monitoring

real-user monitoring (RUM)
report-centralized service

New Relic - Data Dog
App Dynamics - CA's APM

don't use any "dead zones" in your systems

dashboards and graphs

#### Economic Value

"top line" and "bottom line"

- business process and drop off in logs with exceptions being thrown
- depth of queues

transparency tools
- improve performance and reduce queues
- bottleneck keeps from increasing top line
- increase bottom line - overscaled
- replace slow-performance or large-footprint with more efficient ones

#### Risk of Fragmentation

see how releases affect user engagement or conversion rates affect latency

#### Logs and Stats

logs and metrics collectors

push or pull mode

Splunk or Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana

#### What to Expose

- Traffic indicators
- Business transaction, for each type
- Users
- Resource pool health
- Database connection health
- Data consumption
- Integration point health
  - circuit breaker state
- Cache health
  
## Configuration Services

ZK and etcd

more than static properties files

times when app can't reach config service

times when notes of config service can't reach the app

pointers on config service
- make sure instances can start without a config service
- make sure instances don't stop working when can't reach config service
- make sure partition config service doesn't shut down the world
- replicate across geographic locations

## Provisioning and Deployment Service

to some orgs deployment is devops

deployment push or pull methods

artifact repository

tag build as it passes stages

### Build Server as an Attack Vector

compromised a plugin

canary deployments - small set with new build first

interconnect layer setup IPs, VLANS, load balancers, or firewall rules

description of needs and wants for platform to supply

## Command and Control

under 100ms config then control not needed

containers start very quickly, configuration used immediately

oracle JVM and caches slow

### Controls to Offer

- reset circuit breakers
- adjust connection pools sizes and timeouts
- disable specific outbound integrations
- reload configuration
- start or stop accepting load
- feature toggles

don't build in self-destruct button
flush cache button also hazardous

### Sending Commands

admin API over HTTP

open API format then GUI for free with Swagger UI

large scales scripts may not suffice

500 instances and stuck in middle

`command queue` 

be careful of dogpile

### Scriptable Interfaces

GUIs not scriptable

Watir and Roboforms to automate them

best long-term is command line

### Remember This

keep operating costs in mind

start with visibility - logging, tracing, metrics

collect and index logs for general patterns

configuration, provisioning, and deployment services for control over dynamic systems

## The Platform Players

k8s, mesos, cloudfoundry, swarm mode

embrace it

don't try to wrap the API

## The Shopping List

- log collection and search
- metrics collection and visualization
- deployment
- configuration service
- instance placement
- instance and system visualization
- scheduling
- IP, overlay network, firewall, and route management
- autoscaler
- alerting and notification

## Wrapping Up

scale up and out

know what's happening and intervene
