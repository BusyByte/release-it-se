# Adaptation

Change is guaranteed. Survival is not.

Touch on people, processes, tools, and designs

## Convex Returns

works when convex relationship between effort and return

## Process and Organization

plan -> do -> check -> act -> plan ...

Deming/Shewhart cycle

OODA loop

market experience and A/B test

Agile and lean - remove delay from `Act`

DevOps - remove even more delay from `Act` and ton of tools to help with `Observe`

next great frontier is in the `deciding` phase

### The Danger of Thrashing

- shifting development priorities
- unending series of crises

"porpoising" over control and not adjusting for delay

- team confusion
- unfinished work
- lost productivity

try to create steady cadence of delivery and feedback

## Platform Team

platform team views application development as it's customer

provide api and command-line provisioning for common capabilities that applications need 
as well as things needed for the control plane:
- compute capacity
- workload management, auto-scaling, vm placement, and overlay networking
- storage
- log collection, storage, and search
- metric collection and visualization
- message queuing and transport
- traffic management and network security
- dynamic dns registration and resolution
- email gateways
- access control, user, group, and role management

each team could build in isolation but aren't valuable in isolation

platform team measured on availability of platform and not applications

Platform team's customers are the development team

### The Fallacy of the "DevOps Team"

## Painless Releases

releases should be as big of an event as getting a `hair cut`

frequent releases forces you to get good at them

faster feedback loop is essential to improvement

outpace competitors and set agenda in the marketplace

if it hurts do it more often

natural reaction is to do it less often because painful

deliver continuously with low risk

canary deployment to try it out

Blue/Green (A/B) deployments

software controlled load balancers help

act as Governors

## Service Extinction

small units of business capability or technology can fail on it's own

key is failure - try different approaches and kill less successful ones

split complexity into different code bases

each one easier to change and prune

user and page based promotions and not just promotions

what to do with the laggard:
- keep both
- take funding from successful one and invest in unsuccessful
- retool unsuccessful one
- delete unsuccessful one
- give up, close shop

most important mart of evolution is extinction

frees team to work on more high value items

## Team-Scale Autonomy

two-pizza team - no bigger than can feed with 2 large pizza

easier to communicate but not the point

can't have two-pizza team with dedicated dba, front-end dev, ifra guru, back-end guru, and machine learning expert, a product manager, a gui designer

each member has to cover more than one discipline

reducing external dependencies

### No Coordinated Deployments

deploying provider and consumer at same time means tightly coupled, try versioning api instead

dependencies across teams creates queueing and timing issues

same for downstream approval processes 

each team manage config without wreaking havoc on everyone else

platform team enable and facilitate team-scale autonomy

## Beware Efficiency 

"fully utilized" may cause anything but "efficient"

keep people busy all the time and overall pace slows to a crawl

keep view of work, not workers

efficient value stream has short cycle time and high throughput

more specialized to today the harder to to change for the future

## Summary

natural order to software is Big Ball of Mud

## System Architecture

"form follows function" is false

"form follows failure"

correct flaws

not as intended, or more difficult than they should be

gaps in solution space

## Evolutionary Architecture

components only allowed formal interfaces between each other

### Bad Layering

UI calls gateway or aggregator

lend themselves to evolutionary architectures:
- microservices
- microkernels and plugins
- event based

trade-offs

### A Note on Microservices

code show on screen smaller than developers head (melon)

forces write small services

easy to overload with twice as many services as developers

## Loose Clustering

loss of individual instance no more significant than a fall of a tree in the forest

no sequence to be brought up

principle of ignorance - should not know other instances in the cluster

no hard linking, only DNS

## Explicit Context

use url with id to lookup rather than just id

can create test harness

global state is hinderance when you need more than one

implicit database connection

## Creation Options

modular systems inherently have more options than monolithic ones

### Splitting

modules or sub-modules

original interface stays same

delegates work to new modules

### Substituting

replacing one module with another

### Augmenting and Excluding

### Inversion

header attached to request for experimentation

### Porting

can add coupling

### Summary

- loose clusters
- evolutionary architecture
- asynchronous
- explicit about context
- create options for the future

## Information Architecture

how structure data

### Messages, Events, and Commands
