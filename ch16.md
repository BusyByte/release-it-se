# Adaptation

Change is guaranteed. Survival is not.

Touch on people, processes, tools, and designs

## Convex Returns

works when convex relationship between effort and return

## Process and Organization

plan -> do -> check -> act -> plan ...

Deming/Shewhart cycle

OODA loop

market experience and A/B test

Agile and lean - remove delay from `Act`

DevOps - remove even more delay from `Act` and ton of tools to help with `Observe`

next great frontier is in the `deciding` phase

### The Danger of Thrashing

- shifting development priorities
- unending series of crises

"porpoising" over control and not adjusting for delay

- team confusion
- unfinished work
- lost productivity

try to create steady cadence of delivery and feedback

## Platform Team

platform team views application development as it's customer

provide api and command-line provisioning for common capabilities that applications need 
as well as things needed for the control plane:
- compute capacity
- workload management, auto-scaling, vm placement, and overlay networking
- storage
- log collection, storage, and search
- metric collection and visualization
- message queuing and transport
- traffic management and network security
- dynamic dns registration and resolution
- email gateways
- access control, user, group, and role management

each team could build in isolation but aren't valuable in isolation

platform team measured on availability of platform and not applications

Platform team's customers are the development team

### The Fallacy of the "DevOps Team"

## Painless Releases

releases should be as big of an event as getting a `hair cut`

frequent releases forces you to get good at them

faster feedback loop is essential to improvement

outpace competitors and set agenda in the marketplace

if it hurts do it more often

natural reaction is to do it less often because painful

deliver continuously with low risk

canary deployment to try it out

Blue/Green (A/B) deployments

software controlled load balancers help

act as Governors

## Service Extinction

small units of business capability or technology can fail on it's own

key is failure - try different approaches and kill less successful ones

split complexity into different code bases

each one easier to change and prune

user and page based promotions and not just promotions

what to do with the laggard:
- keep both
- take funding from successful one and invest in unsuccessful
- retool unsuccessful one
- delete unsuccessful one
- give up, close shop

most important mart of evolution is extinction

frees team to work on more high value items
